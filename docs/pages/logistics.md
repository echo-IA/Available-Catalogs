# Connection
Most workshop communication will take place in our dedicated Slack space.
Participants will be added to Slack by the organizers.
Remote participation will also be possible via Zoom, with connection details shared in Slack
closer to the start of the workshop.

If you would like to join the echo-IA GitHub organization,
which will host repositories related to the workshop, please provide your GitHub username [here](https://forms.gle/i44GjtfSNJ7YUWjK6).

All scheduled talks will be streamed, but not every work session will have a virtual option,
and some may be online only. Since the workshop is intended to be highly interactive and self-organized, 
the availability of in-person or online participation will depend on the organizers of individual sessions
and the level of interest.

# Travel


The nearest airport is [Raleigh-Durham (RDU)](https://www.rdu.com/maps-and-directions/). 

In addition to Uber / Lyft, some hotels also provide shuttle services to Duke,
so be sure to check if your booked hotel offers this option. 
There are also public transport options around the Research Triangle.
The GoTriangle bus system (for transportation between Durham, Chapel Hill, and Raleigh) currently
charges [fare](https://gotriangle.org/fares-passes). 
However, within Durham, the GoDurham bus system and the Duke University bus system are **free**.

# Weather

In mid-September, central North Carolina typically experiences warm and humid conditions,
with average daytime temperatures ranging from [75–85°F (24–30°C)](https://www.usclimatedata.com/climate/durham/north-carolina/united-states/usnc0192).
We recommend bringing a reusable water bottle and light clothing to stay comfortable outdoors.
Indoor venues in the U.S. are often air-conditioned, so packing an extra layer is advisable.
