We are excited to announce the latest installment of **echo-IA**, **CAROLINA: Connecting Analyses and Research On Lensing and INtrinsic Alignments**,  
to be held at Duke University from **Monday, September 15 – Friday, September 19, 2025**.  

The core meeting will focus on hands-on collaboration, with most of the week dedicated to project incubation, technical discussions, and cross-survey coordination. Activities on Friday will build on work completed throughout the week, including final presentations, planning follow-ups, and group tag-ups.

# Intrinsic Alignments

Intrinsic Alignments (IA) refer to the correlated orientations of galaxies due to the large-scale tidal fields
in which they form.  
Unlike gravitational lensing, which distorts galaxy shapes through intervening matter along the line of sight,
IA arises from galaxies’ own formation and environments.  

For a deeper dive, see *The IA Guide: A Breakdown of Intrinsic Alignment Formalisms* —
a comprehensive and accessible overview, available on arXiv: [2309.08605](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08605).

Characterizing IA is essential for upcoming cosmological surveys to reach their science goals.
IA is best constrained through **synergies across surveys**, particularly by combining imaging and spectroscopic data.  

CAROLINA will bring together members of cosmological surveys and theory/simulation groups working on IA.
The workshop will include overview talks (broad introductions and updates on recent advancements),
technical sessions, and short participant talks.
Most of the schedule will be reserved for collaborative 
work and discussion. Virtual participation will be available for all talks and select work sessions.

# About echo-IA

The CAROLINA workshop is organized as part of
**[echo-IA (Enabling Cosmology with Homogenized Observations of Intrinsic Alignments)](https://github.com/echo-IA)**,
a community initiative uniting measurement and modeling experts to coordinate analyses of IA in a common framework
for future surveys.  

Previous echo-IA workshops include:  
- [2024 – LILAC: Linking Intrinsic Alignments Across Collaborations (at Harvard University)](https://echo-ia.github.io/LILAC/)  
- [2023 – hol-IA: a holistic approach to galaxy intrinsic alignments (at Leiden University)](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/hol-ia-a-holistic-approach-to-galaxy-intrinsic-alignments.html)  
- [2022 – Kickoff Workshop (online)](https://echo-ia.github.io/FebKickoff/)
