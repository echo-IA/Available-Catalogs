This workshop is intended to be a collaborative and productive event.  
We invite participants to propose topics for focused discussion and work sessions (sprints),
as well as areas for ongoing collaboration within echo-IA.
Proposals can range from technical challenges and coding hacks to broader science discussions
and coordination across surveys.  

You can suggest a topic directly in the registration form or by clicking the button below:  

<div class="text-center my-3">

     class="btn btn-info btn-lg">

  </a>
</div>

All proposed sessions can be found [here](https://github.com/echo-IA/CAROLINA/issues).  
Please comment on the proposals (assign yourself) to indicate your interest or to suggest related ideasâ€”this helps us
plan the schedule around community priorities.
