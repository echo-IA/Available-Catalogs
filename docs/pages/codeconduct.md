# Code of Conduct

The CAROLINA (echoIA) Workshop is committed to creating a work environment that is safe, professional, and grounded
in mutual trust — one where diversity and inclusion are valued, and where everyone is entitled to be treated
with courtesy and respect. These workshops bring together people from many backgrounds, and it is through this 
diversity of skills, identities, and experiences that our community grows and thrives. 

The organizing teams are committed to making the workshops and all associated activities productive and enjoyable
for everyone.

**As members of the community, we pledge:**

* To treat all people with respect and provide a harassment- and bullying-free environment, regardless of sex, sexual orientation and/or gender identity, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, ethnicity, religion, or career stage. Sexist, racist, exclusionary, or otherwise inappropriate jokes or language are not tolerated.
* To provide respectful criticism and feedback in our discussions and collaborations. We aim to model behavior that encourages productive exchange and better scientific outcomes, even in the presence of disagreement, while fully respecting individual differences and boundaries.
* To welcome questions and answer them respectfully — especially from early-career participants or those new to the field. We acknowledge that a variety of perspectives and backgrounds enrich our work.
* To help uphold this code of conduct by not remaining silent in the face of violations. If you witness inappropriate behavior, you are encouraged to report it by contacting an organizer in person, emailing [insert contact email], or using an anonymous form (if available).
* To respect each other’s privacy and rights to their image and intellectual property. Always ask permission before sharing photos, screenshots, recordings, or personal content.


## Consequences

If violations of this code of conduct are reported, the organizing team may take appropriate action, which may include a warning or removal from the workshop without refund. Harassment, intimidation, or repeated disrespectful behavior will not be tolerated.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all participants, including:
* Speakers
* Organizers
* Volunteers
* Attendees

It applies in all official workshop settings, including:
* In-person workshop spaces at Duke University
* Zoom meeting rooms
* Collaborative platforms (e.g., GitHub, Google Drive, Slack or other backchannels)
