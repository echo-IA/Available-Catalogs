          <p>
            echoIA is a community effort to build a <strong>unified pipeline for Intrinsic Alignment (IA) analyses</strong>.
            The first step is simple but powerful: <strong>collect</strong> publicly available galaxy shape catalogs in one place,
            with clean links and minimal, comparable metadata so everyone can see whatâ€™s out there at a glance.

              <p>
                <strong>Intrinsic Alignments (IA)</strong> are correlations in galaxy orientations caused by large-scale tidal fields.
                Unlike gravitational lensing (a line-of-sight shear from intervening matter), IA is an in-situ effect tied to galaxy
                formation and environment. Getting IA right is essential for current and upcoming cosmology surveys to meet their
                precision goals.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>echoIA</strong> brings together observers, theorists, and survey teams to coordinate IA measurements and modeling,
                with a shared vocabulary and interoperable tools that make results easier to compare and combine.

            <!-- Why shape catalogs first -->
            <section>
              <header><h3>Why start with shape catalogs?</h3></header>
              <p>
                A <em>shape catalog</em> provides per-galaxy shape measurements (e.g., ellipticities/shear) plus basic context
                like redshifts and quality flags. Catalogs are the raw ingredients for IA analyses. By indexing them with consistent
                top-level fields and stable links (often DOIs on Zenodo or institutional repositories), we make discovery fast and
                comparisons fair.
              </p>
              <p class="minor">
                We do <strong>not</strong> host datasets; each catalog remains under its own license and citation. We only point you
                there with clear metadata.
