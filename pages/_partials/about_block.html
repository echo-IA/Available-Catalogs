      <p>
        <strong>echoIA</strong> (Enabling Cosmology with Homogenized Observations of Intrinsic Alignments)
        is a community effort to build a unified pipeline for <em>Intrinsic Alignment</em> (IA) analyses.
        Our first step is simple but powerful: collect publicly available <strong>galaxy shape catalogs</strong>
        in one place with clean links and minimal, comparable metadata so everyone can quickly see what’s out there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shape catalogs provide per-galaxy shape measurements (e.g., ellipticities/shear) plus basic context like
        redshifts and flags. We don’t host data—each catalog stays at its original home (often a DOI on Zenodo or a
        survey repository)—we just make discovery fast and comparisons fair.
